<p>Members of Socialist Alternative voiced their opposition to Trumpcare and discussed strategies on how to build a coalition days after Senate Republicans released a revised version of the health bill, at the U.E hall in Chicago Saturday.  </p>  
<br>
<p>Attendees said their main concerns about the bill are the cuts to Medicaid, the expected increase in premiums for pre-existing conditions, and the involvement of for profit corporations. </p>   
<br>
<p>“I think Trumpcare is a savage attack on working-class people and what we wanted to do today is come together and talk about how to effectively fight back against Trumpcare,” said Theresa Powers, executive committee member of Socialist Alternative.  </p>  
<br>
<p>Criticizing Democrats for not leading the resistance against the bill, even though no Democrat has publicly supported it, Powers encouraged members to spread their message. </p> 
<br>
<p>“I think that leaves an opening for regular people to kind of step up, and really fight back and call for Medicare for All,” a plan she said she believes would be more beneficial than Trumpcare and Obamacare. </p>       
<br>

<p>
Mateusz Tomkowiak, who studied policy consequences of health politics in America as a Ph.D. candidate at Princeton, cited the cuts to Medicaid as his major concern. “You can’t cut that much money out of a service and expect that people won’t be hurt,” he said.</p>
<br>
<p>Calling it a death poll, Tomkowiak said he believes the bill is not only unfair but also immoral. </p>
<br>
<p>Tomkowiak proposes a third-party political movement, “The Democrats themselves are a party that’s still tied to the for-profit health insurance industry,” he said. </p>
<br>
<p>A fellow supporter of the third-party movement is Hector Salazar. He advocates for cuts in military spending and increase in taxes for the “billionaires”, a group he defined as beneficiaries of working people’s labor. </p>
<br>
<p>The consensus amongst members of Socialist Alternative is that the single-payer healthcare would be the ideal healthcare system in America. </p>
<br>
<p>Powers said that moving forward, the organization hopes to achieve its goal by occupying senators’ offices, working with other organizations to organize and sponsor Medicaid for All rallies, in anticipation of the Senate vote on the bill next week.</p>
